            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The Auditor app uses hardware-based security features to validate the identity of a
            device along with authenticity and integrity of the operating system. It will verify
            that the device is running the stock operating system with the bootloader locked and
            that no tampering with the operating system has occurred. A downgrade to a previous
            version will also be detected. It builds upon the hardware-based verification of the
            operating system by performing basic software-based sanity checks and gathering
            additional information about device state and configuration beyond what the hardware
            can attest to directly.</p>
            <p>The foundation of the Auditor app is generating a persistent key in the <a
            href="https://source.android.com/security/keystore/">hardware-backed keystore</a>
            for verifying the identity of the device and providing assurance that the operating
            system hasn't been tampered with or downgraded via verified boot. It performs a
            pairing process between the device performing verification (Auditor) and the device
            being verified (Auditee) to implement a Trust On First Use (TOFU) model. The device
            performing verification can either be another Android device running the app in the
            Auditor mode or the https://attestation.app/ service for automated verification on a
            regular schedule.</p>
            <p><a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">Verified boot</a>
            validates the integrity and authenticity of firmware and the entire operating system
            (both the kernel and userspace) from an immutable hardware root of trust. The results
            are passed along to the hardware-backed keystore and used to protect the keys.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://source.android.com/security/keystore/attestation">key attestation</a>
            feature provided by the hardware-backed keystore provides direct support for attesting
            to device properties and bootstrapping the Trust On First Use model of the Auditor app
            with a basic initial verification chained up to a known root certificate. The latest
            version of key attestation provides a signed result with the verified boot state,
            verified boot key, a hash of all data protected by verified boot and the version of
            the operating system partitions among other properties. It also has support for
            chaining trust to the application performing the attestation checks, which is used by
            the Auditor app for bootstrapping checks at the software layer.</p>
            <p>Security enhancements offered by future generations of hardware and future Android
            releases will be closely tracked by these projects. The core workflow and feature set
            is already implemented but the foundation will be regularly improved along with major
            improvements to the user interface and documentation. The app and service are designed
            to be forwards and backwards compatible via a versioned protocol to permit substantial
            changes down the road.</p>
