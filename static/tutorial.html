            <h2>Local verification</h2>
            <p>The device being verified (Auditee) must be one of the supported devices. Android
            developer previews aren't supported since the hardware verified version is set to a
            placeholder value. The device performing verification (Auditor) just needs to be any
            Android 7.0+ compatible device with a camera.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>press Auditor on the device that will be verifying the Auditee</li>
                <li>press Auditee on the device that's going to be verified</li>
                <li>point the camera of the Auditee at the QR code on the Auditor to read the challenge</li>
                <li>tap the QR code on the Auditor to advance ahead (if you do this too early, you can press back)</li>
                <li>point the camera of the Auditor at the QR code on the Auditee to read the attestation</li>
                <li>view verification of the attestation results</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Scheduled remote verification</h2>
            <p>An Auditor can verify any number of different Auditee devices. It shows a
            fingerprint and the first / last verification time in successful paired attestation
            results. An Auditee can be verified by any number of Auditors but there will be a
            different fingerprint for each unique pairing rather than the same fingerprint shown
            on each Auditor for the same Auditee.</p>
            <p>To set up regularly scheduled remote verification via the remote attestation service:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>create an account on https://attestation.app/ from a separate device</li>
                <li>press the menu button in the app</li>
                <li>press the 'Enable remote verification' action in the menu</li>
                <li>scan the account QR code displayed on https://attestation.app/</li>
                <li>configure an alert email address to receive alerts if the device fails to provide valid attestations in time</li>
                <li>refresh https://attestation.app/ to view the initial attestation result</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Expanding device support</h2>
            <p>Support for verifying a device needs to be added to the app based on at least one
            valid key attestation sample from the stock OS with the bootloader locked. The Auditor
            app can theoretically support verifying any Android devices launched with Android 8 or
            later. An upgrade to Android 8 isn't enough since hardware key attestation support is
            required and the minimum requirements only became mandatory with Android 8.</p>
            <p>To submit a sample, open the menu from the action bar and select 'Submit sample
            data'. This will submit a sample attestation and device information, enabling the
            development of support for the device. It may take a few weeks before support is
            shipped in a new version of the app.</p>
            <p>A valid key attestation sample for each device model along with a stripped down
            subset of the system properties is published
            <a href="https://github.com/AndroidHardening/AttestationSamples">on GitHub</a> to help
            other projects interested in using key attestation.</a>
